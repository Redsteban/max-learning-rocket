# Vercel Deployment Setup Guide

## ✅ Build Status
The application builds successfully and all pages are generated.

## 🔧 Required Environment Variables for Vercel

You need to add these environment variables in your Vercel project settings:

1. Go to your Vercel project dashboard
2. Click on "Settings" tab
3. Click on "Environment Variables" in the left sidebar
4. Add the following variables:

### Required Variables:
```
ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=your-anthropic-api-key-here
```
(Get your API key from .env.local file or from Anthropic's website)

### Optional Variables (for future Supabase features - NOT NEEDED NOW):
```
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=your-supabase-url-here
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your-supabase-anon-key-here
```
**Note:** The app currently uses localStorage for data storage, so Supabase is not required for the app to work.

## 🚀 After Adding Environment Variables:

1. Click "Save" in the environment variables section
2. Go to the "Deployments" tab
3. Click on the three dots menu on your latest deployment
4. Click "Redeploy"
5. Wait for the deployment to complete

## 📱 Application Structure:

- **Main Page (`/`)**: Redirects to login or register based on setup status
- **Registration (`/register`)**: Create new account with emoji password
- **Login (`/login`)**: Login with emoji password
- **Dashboard (`/dashboard`)**: Main learning hub after login
- **Modules (`/modules`)**: Learning modules selection
- **Claude AI (`/claude`)**: AI chat assistant

## 🧪 Testing the Application:

1. Visit your Vercel URL: `https://max-learning-rocket.vercel.app`
2. You should be redirected to `/register` for first-time setup
3. Create an account with a name and 4-emoji password
4. After setup, you'll be redirected to login
5. Use your emoji password to access the dashboard

## 🐛 Troubleshooting:

If you still get 404 errors after setting environment variables:

1. Check the Vercel Function Logs:
   - Go to Vercel Dashboard → Functions tab
   - Look for any error messages

2. Check Build Logs:
   - Go to Deployments tab
   - Click on the deployment
   - Check "Build Logs" for any issues

3. Verify the deployment URL:
   - Make sure you're using the correct URL
   - Try accessing specific routes like `/register` or `/login`
